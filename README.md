# Challenge-WordFinder
I've started with the implementation of a clean architecture, that allows me to make the solution more scalable 
generally, I try to implement the next layers:
- API/ or for this exercise the Main Program
- Services where I generally I put the business rules
- Model and Data
My next step was to try to get a Walking skeleton where I can have the main focus of the exercise or the solution.
And Finally Iâ€™ve run some test and made some corrections
